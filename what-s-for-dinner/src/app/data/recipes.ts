It's reducing the juices that forms the crust.\n\nCover and allow a crust to form on the bottom for about 10 minutes. Stir and scrape up the crust distributing it throughout the hash.\n\nRepeat this at least 2 more times for about 30 minutes. Every 10 minutes or so scrape up and mix the crust into the hash. We want a nice crusty texture throughout the hash.\n\nFor the final crusting stir in the swiss cheese, parsley and thyme. Carefully taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.\n\nLet cook for 10 minutes uncovered and a crust will form on the bottom.",

It will take several minutes for the Instant Pot to come up to pressure before the actual cook time begins.\n\nWhile the beef shank precooks, prepare an ice bath. \n\nOnce the cook time is up and the Instant Pot beeps, carefully quick release the pressure with the steam vent. \n\nRemove the beef shank using tongs and submerge it in the ice bath for 10 minutes.

Slice into 1/2-inch pieces. \n\nAdd the star anise, ginger, and bay leaves to a spice ball or wrap them in cheesecloth and tie up the bundle with string. This will help contain the spices for easy removal at the end.\nMake the soup:\nTo the Instant Pot, add the dark soy sauce, soy sauce, toban djan, chili crisp, sugar, garlic, and white pepper. Stir until dissolved. Add the onions, tomatoes, and beef shank. \n\nAdd enough water to reach the 4-quart mark, about 7 cups.  \n\nLock on the lid and make sure the valve is set to seal.

Top with the remaining grated cheese.\n\nBake until the cheese fully melts, about 10 minutes. \n\nServe immediately while the enchiladas are still warm.
